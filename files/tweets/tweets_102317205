b'@EKEDP Dear Engineer Oluwagbemiga(IbejuDistrict)\n\nGreetings.\n\nOgombo road and environs are suffering terribly from power outage. Power comes at ridiculous and odd hours.\n\nWhat exactly can be done to get power at really needed periods instead of at odd hours e.g 1:30am.\n\nThanks.'

b'All the agencies involved........more grease to your elbows. However LASG you must restrict these tankers from roaming during the day, and set up a monitoring body to catch and crush tankers that disobey the order. Lets just value lives........i beg una https://t.co/4dFJXCDTRs'

b'Sir Gbenga nice one. However its not enough. Pls stop these tankers from roaming during the day and restrict them using a regulatory body to catch and crush their tankers if they disobeyed. Do you guys really really really value Nigerian lives???? https://t.co/dpNXABJvnL'

b'With all due respect this has nothing to do with emergency planning. It has all to do with concrete policies to stop tankers from moving during the day and making sure a regulatory body follows through in making sure tankers adhere to safety. https://t.co/qDpr55lja3'
