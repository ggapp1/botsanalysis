b'TLDR: Marty is under-performing when he needs to be over-performing in districts he already won. This leaves him with one path to victory: to win a majority of absentee votes deep in Gounardes territory. 77% to be precise. November doesn\'t seem to be a "Golden" month so far. 8/8'
b'',b'',2018-11-15 19:42:05,21,4,1
b"However, it's important to note, since Gounardes won the Absentees in a Marty-leaning district, the opposite could happen too, with Golden taking most absentees in a Gounardes district. Anything's possible. 7/8"
b'',b'',2018-11-17 14:53:57,14,3,1
b"This also means more absentees will be coming from Democratic-leaning AD's when the count continues, a *very* good thing for Andrew. Marty needed a statistical anomaly to catch up, or even reach a 300 vote margin for a recount. That anomaly hasn't appeared yet. 6/8"
b'',b'',2018-11-17 14:53:57,2,2,1
b"If we were breaking down the 2206 total absentees votes evenly, there should have been 142 votes in AD41 (actual: 97) and 232 in AD45 (actual: 164). Again, both are important Marty-leaning districts. He's underperforming to even maintain his current loss ratio. 5/8"
b'',b'',2018-11-17 14:53:57,3,2,1
b"AD45's absentee loss is significant: it was the AD with the most votes for Marty, at 4,396 on election day. The second-largest was AD59, yet to be counted, with 3,411. Also, there are only two Marty-dominated districts out of *seven* left to be counted. 4/8"
b'',b'',2018-11-17 14:53:57,3,2,1
b"Basically, he's underperforming in both areas, by 6 points in AD41, which had 6% of the vote on election day, and by 20 points in AD45, which has 11% of total votes on election day. 3/8"
b'',b'',2018-11-17 14:53:57,3,2,1
b'We have, thanks to @KadiaGoba, data for two out of nine districts, AD41 and AD45. Both went for Marty on election day: he took 58% and 68% of the election day votes there, respectively. He took only 52% and *48%* of the absentees, per the Friday count. 2/8'

b'',b'',2018-10-30 18:07:39,3858,2854,1
b"Second, some background. Yes, I've tweeted this before but everything old is still ongoing, I guess.  \n\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews were barred from many trades and professions, and it was sometimes illegal for Jews to own land."
b'',b'http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-anti-semitic-mailer-20181030-story.html',2018-10-30 18:10:59,414,81,1
b'It was convenient for local authorities to permit Jews to work in trades that were repugnant to Christians  most notably moneylending, which was associated in the Christian world with depravity and sin.'
b'',b'',2018-10-30 18:11:00,704,105,1
b'From a Jewish perspective, moneylending was useful for two main reasons.  \n\n1) It was somewhat portable, which was practical during an era when expulsions of Jews from villages and even whole countries were not uncommon.'
b'',b'',2018-10-30 18:11:00,728,102,1
b'2) It was also profitable. Most late medieval and early modern European polities taxed Jews at jaw-droppingly high rates, so moneylendings income was often essential for communities survival. \n\nNote that both of these reasons are intricately tied to anti-Jewish oppression.'
b'',b'',2018-10-30 18:11:00,691,73,1
b'And so, a trope was born.  Even as a small subset of Jews were pushed into moneylending, they were resented for it  and identified with the work in a way that Christian bankers never were.'

b'100 days from today is the general election. In order to win back the House and Senate, us Democrats must ignore the polls, work as if we are behind and sprint through the finish line. We must turn out in such big numbers, GOP cheating and Russian attacks cant win. Onward! '

b'White-passing #actuallyautistic people need to think a bit more carefully about telling #POC to #TakeTheMaskOff. For many of us, wearing that mask in a bigoted society is what has kept us alive. Wed love to take it off as freely as you all seem to be able to, but its not safe.'
