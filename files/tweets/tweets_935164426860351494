b'1) More big breaking news, which further undercuts the Ford accusation, as well as media handling of it. A source has given me the email that WaPo reporter Emma Brown sent to Mark Judge, one person Ford claims was at the party. This email is dated Sunday, Sept. 16, 2018'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 02:22:55,6,5,1
b'2) The email wants a comment from him. The subsequent story would reveal Christine Ford\'s name, and give details of the supposed "assault."'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:15,22847,13514,1
b'3) One part of the email to Judge reads: "In addition to Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, whom she called acquaintances she knew from past socializing, she recalls that her friend Leland (last name then was Ingham, now Keyser) was at the house and a friend of the boys named PJ."'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:16,5408,2383,1
b"4) This matters for two big reasons--Ford's credibility and WaPo's. The subsequent WaPo story would go on to cite Ford's name and details, and also list notes from a therapist that Ford told this to in 2012. Read carefully what WaPo reports, the same day it emails Judge:"
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:16,5320,2404,1
b'5) "The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapists part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:16,5418,2469,1
b'6) Wait, say what? WaPo reports publicly that Ford says it was "four boys,"even after WaPo reporter tells Judge that Ford had told her it was three boys and a girl.'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:17,5274,2418,1
b"7) So first, huge problem: This was just a week ago, and we have Ford giving two different accounts of who was present. Four boys. No, three boys, one girl. Either way, therapist notes from 2012 definitively say four boys, which Ford didn't dispute. But now... a girl!"
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:17,5965,2825,1
b"8) Other problem: WaPo's reporting. Reporter has for a week had the names of those Ford listed as present. One is a woman. Yet it writes a story saying FOUR BOYS. Why? Maybe a mistake. But if so, why did WaPo never correct that narrative?"
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:17,7402,3419,1
b"9) What, you can't find Keyser? She has lived in the DC area a long time. The paper had no trouble tracking down the other two men (btw, who also denied such party). And why not publish Keyser's name? It published the other men's names."
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:17,6530,2944,1
b'10) In its most recent update tonight, WaPo writes: "Before her name became public, Ford told The Post she did not think Keyser would remember the party because nothing remarkable had happened there, as far as Keyser was aware."'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:18,6736,2888,1
b'11) Wow. "Before her name became public, Ford told..." That is WaPo admitting that it had the name, and had Ford\'s response to what would clearly be a Keyser denial, but NEVER PUT IT OUT THERE. Again, why? A lot of people have a lot questions to answer.'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:21,6854,3009,1
b'Hearing that the other woman at the alleged party (the one missing witness, as identified by the accuser) has come forward &amp; says she doesnt know Kavanaugh &amp; has no recollection of attending any party that he did. \n\nFour alleged witnesses. All four do not corroborate her story.'
b'',b'',2018-09-23 03:47:22,14087,6428,1
b'Wow. And CNN reporting that the fourth person, Leland Keyser, is denying memory of knowing kavanaugh or of this event, even though "Keyser is a lifelong friend of Ford\'s."\nWow, again.'
